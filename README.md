### Description:
This game is a variant of Pokemon Fire Red built on Unity with some gameplay differences.  

#### Objective:
Professor Oak needs your help collecting data on the local wildlife of this newly discovered island that you find yourself in. Using his lended aid, go into the wilderness north of the city and defeat at least 5 creatures to complete your task! But be careful, some of the monsters appear strong than others, don't let your trusty ally be defeated!!

#### Game Play:
This game uses the arrow keys along with mouse.

### Base Code/Tutorial
This game was acutally originally going to use our recent scavenger project found [here](https://github.com/gusmccoy/scavenger). But it ended up being more scaffolding/support system; Collect-Them-All progressed, it became more and more independent of it's parent code. In the end, the only thing this project had in common with the Scavenger "parent" was that they are both 2D! We are proud to claim that this game was original rather than from a tutorial!!

### Potential Areas of Improvement for this Project
***As mentioned in the videos, this game can grow in many different ways; here are some that we thought of:***   
- The player can enter the buildings within the town
- More NPCs throughout the map, giving the player tips and tricks
- More developed seperation of different monsters into different habitats (briefly done with the pond in the demo)
- Monsters developed more with names and more unique features like audio or adding defence and speed stats to influence battle outcomes.
- Improved battle mechanics such as a chance the `Run` button fails, a chance for an attack to miss.
